 +) Swap Device: A swap device is a storage device or partition that is used to extend the amount of virtual memory available to a system. When the system's physical memory (RAM) is fully utilized, the operating system can move inactive pages of memory to the swap device to free up RAM for other tasks.
 +) Swap Memory: Swap memory, also known as virtual memory, is a portion of the storage space that is used as an 
extension of the system's physical memory (RAM). Swap memory allows the system to handle more processes and data 
than would fit in the physical RAM alone.
